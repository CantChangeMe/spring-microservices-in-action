## Overview
This source code was re-organized by the [original source code](https://www.manning.com/downloads/1578) of the book and I make sure each module is runnable.

There are the differences between this source code and the original source code:
* Use Gradle as Java build automation tool rather than Maven.
* Use MySQL as database rather than PostgreSQL in the licensing service.
