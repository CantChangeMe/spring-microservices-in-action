# spring-microservices-in-action

This repository contains the source code of the book "Spring Microservices in Action (John Carnell)".

## Overview
This source code was re-organized by the [orignal source code](https://www.manning.com/downloads/1578) of the book and make sure each module is runnable.

There are the differences between this source code and the original source code:
* Use Gradle as Java build automation tool rather than Maven.
* Use MySQL as database in the licensing service rather than PostgreSQL.
